**SCPUtils Plugin**<br />

Welcome to SCPUtils, overtime i implemented many features so i decided to rework the documentation.

This is the list of SCPUtils features with a brief description, i recomend to read configs:

- **Welcome Message:** You can set in server config a welcome broadcast that every player join will see.
- **Decontamination Message:** A broadcast that all players will see when decontamination starts
- **Auto-Restart:** Having only one player in server may cause round stuck forever, with this plugin you can avoid it!
- **Advanced SCP Suicide / Quit punishements:** If a SCP suicide or leave the server you can punish him, with warns, kicks or bans, depending on settings you use and DC/Suicide percentage player has (configurable also for tutorial role)
- **Temporarily badges:** Sometimes may be useful to give a player a temporarily role for event winners and donators (or anything else you want), with this plugin it's easy, see commands list.
- **Custom nicknames:** Admins with permission can set any nickname to any player in server using admin console, users with permission can set their own nickname using a simple command on User's console.
- **Nickname Blacklist:** You can prevent players joining with blacklisted nicknames and preventing them to change nicknames to restricted ones, users with bypassnickname permission bypass this limit!
- **Badge colors:** Admins can assign a color to every person, users with permissions can assign any color to themselves if it's not in restricted list!
- **Permanently show/hide badges:** Users with permission can permanently show or hide badge using a simple command (in user console)
- **SCPSpeak features:** Playing with permissions you can decide which badge (even default one) can speak with that SCP like 939 using V!
- **Playtime statistics:** You can see each user playtime day per day or total playtime using a simple command!
- **ASNs Bans:** You can ban specific ASNs to avoid ban evaders and cheaters, you can whitelist legit users to bypass the ASNs bans using a simple command, to add an ASN to blacklist add it inside server config setting.

**Database will get created inside Exiled/SCPUtils folder.**<br /><br />

**Config Example**

To edit your configs you must go into EXILED folder and edit port-config.yml file (example 7777-config.yml), and edit them<br />


<br />To edit permissions you must go into Plugins/Exiled Permissions folder and edit permissions.yml file, bellow you can see a sample config<br />

```
    user:
    inheritance: []
        default: true
        permissions:
        - scputils_speak.scp049
    owner:
        permissions:
        - '*'
    admin:
    inheritance: []
        permissions:       
        - scputils.playerinfo
        - scputils.playerlist
        - scputils.changecolor
        - scputils.changenickname
        - scputils.badgevisibility
        - scputils.playerresetpreferences
        - scputils_speak.*      
    vip:
    inheritance: []
        permissions:        
        - scputils.changecolor
        - scputils.changenickname     
        - scputils_speak.*	  
```		
		
<br />Using scputils.* grants every permission that starts with prefix scputils
Using '*' grants every possible permission on the server<br />
To verify if you yml file is valid paste it into this website: http://www.yamllint.com/<br />
Note: you must add every group in permissionsm don't forget default one<br /><br />

Data stored on database is intended only for internal use, sharing it is a violation of SCP:SL EULA and will cause your server delist.<br /><br />
